# LoRA-Communication-Module-
Created a wireless messaging System without using any GSM Network or any wired Connection 

By using this we are able to send text messages from one device to another without using Internet, Bluetooth or Wire connections between the devices.
The device is able to send messages ranging from 1 to 15kms within the few milli seconds

We can majorly communicate between any two devices as between:
1. 2 computers
2. 2 mobile (using an mobile applixcation to connect wireless to the arduino board)
3. 1 mobile and 1 computer

This the Circuit Diagram
